# The Summary 

**Firstly** i read an article talking about Domin and whats the problems in understanding the domin and they say that the programming is easy easy if i learn and know the domin .

**Secondly** Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array literals, functions, and nested object literals .
*object literal syntax*
A colon separates property name
A comma separates each name 
we use oObject literals enable us to write code that supports lots of features yet still provide a relatively straightforward process for implementers of our code.

**Thirdly** Document Object Model (DOM)
A Document object represents the HTML document that is displayed in that window
Objects are organized in a hierarchy. This hierarchical structure applies to the organization of objects in a Web document.
Document object âˆ’ Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. The document contains the contents of the page.
