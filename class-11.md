1. *Parcitical Information*

The first Thing i want to talk about is **Images** can improve the design and the appearance of a web page ,images are defined with the <img> tag.The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only and does not have a closing tag.
The src attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the image:<img src="url">.
The alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader)The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:<img src="     " alt="image name">


The Second thing i want to talk about **Parcitical Information**
