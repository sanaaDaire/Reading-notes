# The Sumary

i want to talk about Error Handling and Debugging .

**ORDER OF EXECUTION**
To find the source of an error, it helps to know how scripts are processed. The order in which statements are executed can be complex; some tasks cannot complete until another statement or function has been run.
 anyway in JavaScript theres a type of Errors :-
 

 1. The try statement lets you test a block of code for errors.

1. The catch statement lets you handle the error.

1. The throw statement lets you create custom errors.

1. The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.


  *Errors Will Happen!* When executing JavaScript code, different errors can occur.
  *Modern browsers will often use a combination of JavaScript and built-in HTML validation, using predefined validation rules defined in HTML attributes*

 If the value is wrong, an exception (err) is thrown.
