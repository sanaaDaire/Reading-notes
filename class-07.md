# The Summary 

**HTML**
*TABLE* A table header is defined with the **th** tag. By default table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the **td** tag .The **td** elements are the data containers of the table.Cell padding specifies the space between the cell content and its borders.
If i do not specify a padding, the table cells will be displayed without padding.

**JavaScript**
*function* this refers to the "owner" of the function.functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object.The parameters of a function call are the function's arguments. Arguments are passed to functions by value. If the function changes the value of an argument, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.

*OBJECTS* Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. (OOP).
